## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
require(readxl)
df <- read_excel("hotdog-contest-winners.xlsx")
head(df)
```
```{r}
install.packages("xlsx")
```
